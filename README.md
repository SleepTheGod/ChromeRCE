This PowerShell script enables remote code execution (RCE) within a Chrome browser by interfacing with the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

Preparation:

Ensure you have Chrome installed and the path to the Chrome executable is correctly set in the $chromePath variable.
This script requires the WebSocket4Net library, which will be downloaded and extracted automatically if not already present.
Execution:

Run the PowerShell script. It will start a new Chrome window with remote debugging enabled on port 9222 and open the specified URL.
JavaScript Code Input:

After Chrome has launched and the page has loaded, you’ll be prompted to enter JavaScript code. This code will be executed on the target webpage.
For example, you could input alert('Hello, World!'); to trigger an alert box on the page or use more complex JavaScript as needed.
Results:

The script sends your JavaScript code to the Chrome DevTools Protocol via a WebSocket connection. It then waits for the code to execute and captures the output.
The results of the JavaScript execution will be displayed in the PowerShell console.
Example Usage:

Launch the Script:
.\RCE.ps

Enter JavaScript Code:

When prompted, input your JavaScript code. For instance, entering document.title would return the title of the current webpage.
View Results:

The result from the executed JavaScript code will be shown in the PowerShell console.
Use Cases:

Debugging and Testing: Automatically execute and test JavaScript on live pages.
Automation: Automate interactions with web pages or test scripts.
Debugging: Identify and troubleshoot JavaScript issues in real-time on specific URLs.
By using this script, you can effectively interact with a webpage remotely and programmatically execute JavaScript, making it a versatile tool for web developers and testers.
